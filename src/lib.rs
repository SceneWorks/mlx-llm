//! `mlx-llm` — on-device text + vision LLM serving engine for Apple MLX.
//!
//! The crate is built bottom-up, mirroring the dependency order of epic 7153:
//!
//! 1. [`primitives`] — the backend-owned tensor leaves the engine needs: a batch-capable
//!    [`KvCache`](primitives::KvCache), a pluggable [`Sampler`](primitives::sampler), the
//!    [`Rope`](primitives::Rope) family, GQA attention helpers, quantization, the `nn` leaves,
//!    and a safetensors [`Weights`](primitives::Weights) loader. These own MLX `Array`s directly
//!    and deliberately depend on nothing from the gen-ai side.
//!
//! Higher layers (the generic decoder, the streaming decode loop, the backend-neutral
//! `core-llm` contract implementation) build on these primitives in later stories.
//!
//! MLX's default Metal device is single-threaded; engine instances hold MLX `Array`s and are
//! therefore neither `Send` nor `Sync`. Drive one engine from one thread (or behind a mutex).
